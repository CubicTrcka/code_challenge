# code_challenge
## A challenge for interviewing QA engineers:

#### go to https://codepen.io/rkpasia/pen/LNEQod and use selenium to create tests for the sign up page

* clone repo

* create your own branch

* set up selenium

* test that the sign up goes through each phase (should pass)

* test that the email requires a @ (should fail)

* test that it denies continuation if the passwords dont match (should fail)

* push to remote repo when done or commit progress as you work on it for bonus points
